/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

    <h1>Redesign Overview Cover Page</h1>
	<h3>Purpose of this page: </h3>
    <p>
This page serves as the cover page to the the Redesigned webpage which lists our changes made to the website. Our homepage also contains links to the deliverables as well. However this is just a list of of our navigation.  
 </p>
 	<p> On the right panel you can navgiate to our other pages and redesigned GSU pages. </p>
    <h2>Resigned Site</h2>
    <p>This is a brief outline of the redesigned GSU website. Not all links are active since this is a preliminary redesign and not a total redesign. The athletics and Course Catalog page links to GSU's external Athletics and course catalog page. While viewing the redesigned site, an asterisk (*) next to a link indicates that there is content we made for that page. while a caret(^) indicates the use of already existing UL material. </p>
