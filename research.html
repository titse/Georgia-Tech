            <br>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>

            <h2>Centers &amp; Insitutes</h2>
            <br>
            <p>GSU is one of four research universities in the University System of Georgia. More than 250 fields of study are offered through some 52 accredited degree programs at the bachelor's, master's, specialist, and doctoral levels. Students may enroll in day or evening classes and in part-time or full-time study. In 2011, $58,492,317 in external research funding was received by Georgia State investigators.</p>

          <div class="divider-line tabspace" id="services">
            <h2>Facilities &amp; Services</h2>
            <br>
            <p> GSU has 22 Facilities and Services that available for faculty and staff. </p>
            <P> Facitlies and Services promote multidisciplinary research and provide a supportive infrastructure for interdisciplinary research complementary to the academic goals of departments of instruction and research. </P>

Facitlies and Services must go through a structured review process that includes a supporting recommendation from the Academic Senate. Each research department is headed by a tenured faculty director and receives financial support and space from the campus. Professional researchers and technical staff can hold their appointments with the deparment, which then serves as their home academic unit. Other units on campus, of a less formal character, may designate themselves as a center or a project, but they are not department unless they have been officially approved as such.

The unique culture of research and administration among the major academic areas has led to a number of different implementation and management models for Departments on the GSU main campus such as  Geospatial Laboratories, Research Computing, and others. </p>
